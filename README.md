# MOMA-FTLB
The MOMA-FTLB we proposed, first, introduces a multi-objective framework driven by Agent behavior. Through a social stratification mechanism and the design of a dynamic signal response mechanism, it significantly improves the efficiency of cloud data centers. Secondly, in the fault-tolerant load balancing method based on multi-objective multi-agent optimization we proposed, we designed a novel multi-objective collaborative optimization mechanism, which accelerates the convergence of the Pareto frontier through a dual-elite strategy. Thirdly, we also proposed an archive clipping mechanism based on crowded distance to maintain the diversity of the solution set. Finally, we introduced a dual perception mechanism of fault-tolerant load balancing in a multi-cloud environment and conducted a large number of experiments in real cloud environments and Large-scale simulation.
